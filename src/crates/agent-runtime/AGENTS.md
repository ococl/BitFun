# agent-runtime Agent Guide

Scope: this guide applies to `src/crates/agent-runtime`.

`bitfun-agent-runtime` owns portable agent runtime decisions that can be built
and tested without `bitfun-core`.

## Guardrails

- Do not depend on `bitfun-core`, app crates, Tauri, ACP protocol, web UI,
  concrete service crates, or product-domain implementations.
- Keep concrete scheduler/session lifecycle execution, session metadata IO, and
  product `Tool` adapters in `bitfun-core` until a reviewed owner migration
  proves behavior equivalence.
- Prefer pure facts and decisions first: queue policy, background delivery,
  dialog-turn queue state, active-turn facts, cancellation routing and
  suppression state, background running-turn injection construction, steering action
  planning, agent-session reply planning, thread-goal accounting/mutation/continuation decisions,
  runtime event facts, registry visibility/availability, round-boundary
  yield/injection state, turn-outcome queue decisions, registry source/profile
  facts, prompt-loop user-context policy, prompt listing reminder ordering,
  prompt-cache policy/identity/store, finish-reason labels, session-state event
  labels, and turn-outcome event facts.
- Keep concrete prompt assembly, workspace context IO, prompt-cache persistence
  wiring, dynamic environment collection, and concrete agent definition loading
  outside this crate until a reviewed migration proves behavior equivalence.
- Add focused tests before moving any runtime decision into this crate.

## Verification

```bash
cargo test -p bitfun-agent-runtime
node scripts/check-core-boundaries.mjs
cargo check -p bitfun-core --features product-full
```
